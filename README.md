# Directory-Tree-Output-Archive
Directory Tree Output Archive for Windows

This is a super simple script to output the tree and list of files on specified drives.

Requirements/Known Issues:

-Cygwin needs to be installed for the "ls" output (C:\msls\ls.exe should exist)

-Need 7-zip installed (C:\Program Files\7-Zip\7z.exe)

-Drive letters need to be in the drive_letters.txt file (one per line)

-A folder for each drive letter needs to be precreated

-You need to edit the "bk_dir" location for where this script and drive_letters.txt is located.
